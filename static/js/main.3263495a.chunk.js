We operate on location and most of the work i was doing was all but impossible to do remotely. Everyone assumed this was a temporary precaution but as the lockdown weeks went on, and one sensationalized newscast after another placing bets on the length of this order; it was clear this could go on for sometime. And it did. Many businesses all around the globe had begun to incur supply chain issues and the clients we worked for were no different. I was furloughed and stuck at home with minimal freelance options as the photographic industry, like many other industries, had grinded to an abrupt halt. This was a problem.

I\u2019ve worked in an agency setting contributing image content to client website builds and watching them go from wireframe to final product and loved it.

Freecodecamp projects, udemy courses, tutorial hell, YouTube, picking my developer friends brains, and so on. It slowly became all I did, I needed to be dragged away from my workspace to catch a day at the beach or a walk in the Wissahickon. It was hard, but I really liked it. I had already known some of the fairly basic concepts, but as i went on i realized very quickly that i knew nothing. And i could probably count on that for some time. Long story short, after months of furlough and self exploration writing code, I got let go from a job i was comfortable with and thought was secure. There just wasn\u2019t enough work coming in and our staff was fairly large. At the time it felt terrible, but looking back on it i realized quite quickly that it was a stagnant position without much room for growth. I wasn\u2019t happy, but i wouldn\u2019t leave either. The growth i wanted all along had now been thrusted upon me. And instead of treating it like a problem, i turned it into a positive. I had more time to pursue learning to write code and build projects, more time than usual given the lack of places to go that were open and a job i was committed to 9-5. Throughout self learning i had a few job opportunities as businesses got shook up and even went and toured a studio that had an open position. All of them were similar opportunities to my previous position and i knew that i wanted more. I wanted some kind of immersive learning structure to actually build useful projects that had deadlines and would force me to progress my knowledge."})}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{className:"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower",children:Object(b.jsx)("span",{className:"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower",children:"I explored a variety of options and eventually took a full stack bootcamp through UPENN. This was extremely accelerated and at times i didn\u2019t think i could actually get through the projects. I would rewatch my sessions and essentially didn\u2019t sleep for months on end locked in my workspace. As soon as i would get comfortable with one concept, the next one would crush me and it continued on that way for awhile. This learning process was both fun and enjoyable but also mentally draining and left me feeling frequently defeated. But i continued to return and use every resource i had to grasp concepts. This education style was good for me because i learned how to properly research and find solutions to issues quickly. Throughout the late nights i found that i was very much interested in the user facing side of development and a passion grew for that over the course of 2020. Many sleepless nights of wondering what the hell i was doing led to suddenly feeling like this is exactly what i should be doing. After completing the course i took some time to decompress and slowly work on other personal projects and my mental well-being. I caught up on sleep. I worked with friends i had met in the course and continued to merge code on projects we worked on, but at a calmer pace. After some relaxation and some job hunting, i found a contract doing front-end development work remotely that has allowed me to use new skills and creative skills i already had and have throughly enjoyed the work so far."})}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)(i.a,{className:"centered",children:Object(b.jsxs)(r.Link,{href:"",to:"tldr",spy:!0,smooth:!0,offset:-70,duration:800,children:[Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("span",{className:"tasty fa wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__slower",children:Object(b.jsx)("a",{children:Object(b.jsx)("i",{className:"fa fa-long-arrow-alt-down fa-4x wow animate__animated animate__bounce animate__delay-1s","aria-hidden":"true"})})})]})}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("h1",{id:"tldr",className:"majorMonoTLDR centered wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown animate_slower helloSize",children:Object(b.jsx)("span",{className:"majorMonoTLDR wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__slower",children:"TL;DR"})}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{className:"lead centered response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower",children:Object(b.jsx)("span",{className:"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower tasty spacedOut",children:"[PROBLEMS]"})}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{className:"lead centered response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower",children:Object(b.jsxs)("span",{className:"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower",children:["STAGNATED CAREER GROWTH",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"+",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"EXCESSIVE COMFORT",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"+",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"GLOBAL PANDEMIC",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"+",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"LOCKDOWN",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"+",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"FURLOUGH",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"+",Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),"LOST JOB"]})}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("br",{}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{className:"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower",children:Object(b.jsx)("span",{className:"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower tasty spacedOut",children:"[SOLUTION]"})}),Object(b.jsx)("p",{className:"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower",children:Object(b.jsx)("span",{className:"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower",children:"I converted a series of extremely stressful problems in my life into pursuing something i had always had interest in.

animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">I’m just like anybody else, i’ve run into many problems in my life. Some larger than others. Some easier to overcome than others. Some i've welcomed and embraced the process of beating, and others have shown up at the wrong time uninvited. I’m what some may consider an optimist and have approached all of these problem types similarly, with the idea that there’s absolutely a solution and I can arrive at it. I don’t know if i’ve been too blindly optimistic at times, but I do know that during my life trajectory this has been an outlook that has worked out for me; so i’ve maintained it. This question mentions the idea of a problem as a plurality. I thought about many of these large and small aforementioned problems and couldn’t initially decide what subject matter I should write about. Should I write about a single large and deeply personal problem? Or maybe a series of small dev related problems.. like an evening of seemingly endless syntax errors, or nonsensical node module issues, or objects that I couldn’t seem to console.log(), or the thousandth time I forgot a semicolon. After thinking it over for a twenty four hour period, I decided to essentially write about both.</span></p><br/>\n\n                    <br/>\n\n\n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">On March 19, 2020, Governor Wolf of Pennsylvania ordered a statewide closure of all \"non-life sustaining businesses, operations, and services”. This affected the studio group that I had been with for many years and a job that I had admittedly grown very comfortable with. We were operating on location and most of the work I was doing was all but impossible to do remotely. Everyone assumed this was a temporary precaution but as the lockdown weeks went on, and one sensationalized newscast after another started placing bets on the length of this order; it was clear this could go on for some time. And as you already know, it did. Many businesses all around the globe had begun to incur supply chain issues and the clients we worked for were no different. I was furloughed and stuck at home with minimal freelance options as the photographic industry, like many other industries, had grinded to an abrupt halt. This was a problem. Millions began to lose their jobs and I knew that in a matter of time it could be me as well.<br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    Supply chain issues = no product = no work = no revenue.</span></p><br/>\n\n\n                    <br/>\n\n\n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">I suddenly found myself with more extra time than I previously ever had in my life. This was the first time in my career that I was collecting unemployment and at first it was unsettling. As days went on I thought about what my next steps would be and how I could occupy my time. Searching for a new job right away in that moment was honestly kind of tough given the lockdowns and I found myself thinking about what I really wanted to do. I had always been interested in the process of building websites since a younger age. I would create small sites to host artwork on or sites where I could write humorous local scene report style blogs. I’ve worked in an agency setting contributing image content to client website builds and loved watching them go from wireframe to final product. I truly wished my contribution could be larger. It was always one of those things that I told myself I should dive deeper into but constantly referenced my lack of “time” as the reason why I hadn’t. Now I had time, for reasons that could ultimately be chalked up to a problem. A global pandemic is a problem. Being furloughed in one is even more so.</span></p><br/>\n\n\n                    <br/>\n\n\n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">So I started like most do, teaching myself, researching, and reading. The usual freeCodeCamp projects, Udemy courses, YouTube, Stack Oveflow, tutorial hell, picking my developer friends brains, and so on. It slowly became all I did, I needed to be dragged away from my workspace to catch a day at the beach or a walk in the Wissahickon. Long story short, after months of furlough and self-exploration writing code, I got let go from a job that I naively thought was secure. There just wasn’t enough work coming in and our staff was fairly large. At the time it felt terrible, but I decided to view it as a blessing in disguise. It was a decent gig and everyone was very nice, but the position didn't have much room for growth. I wasn’t happy, but I wouldn’t force myself to leave either. I kept myself stuck. That was a problem. Now, the growth I wanted all along had been dropped directly on my head. And instead of treating it like a negative issue, I turned it into a positive one. I had more time to pursue learning and to build projects. Specifically given the lack of places to go that were open, and lack of a job that I was committed to 9-5. Throughout my lockdown learning I did eventually look into a few photo industry job opportunities and even went and toured a studio that had an open position. All of them felt very similar to my previous situation and I knew that I wanted more. I wanted to be challenged. I wanted some kind of immersive learning structure to actually build useful projects that had deadlines and would force me to progress my knowledge.</span></p><br/>\n\n\n                    <br/>\n\n\n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">I explored a variety of options and eventually took a full stack bootcamp through UPENN. This was extremely accelerated and at times I didn’t think I could actually complete the course. I would rewatch my sessions and essentially didn’t sleep for months on end locked in my workspace. As soon as I would get comfortable with one concept, the next one would crush me and it continued on that way for awhile. This learning process was both fun and enjoyable but also mentally draining and left me feeling frequently defeated. But I persisted on. This educational style was good for me because I learned how to properly research and find solutions to issues quickly out of necessity. It also taught me that nobody ever has the answer to everything, an idea that makes me smile even as I write this. I thoroughly enjoy the state of constant discovery. Throughout the late nights I found that I was very much interested in the user facing side of development and a passion grew for that over the course of 2020. Many sleepless nights of wondering what on earth I was doing led to suddenly feeling like this is exactly what I should be doing.</span></p><br/>\n\n\n                    <br/> \n                    \n                    \n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">After completing the course I took some time to decompress and slowly work on other personal projects. I caught up on some sleep. I spent time with my partner. I went on long bicycle rides. I worked with friends I had met in the course and continued to merge code on projects we worked on, but at a calmer pace. After some relaxation and some job hunting, I found a solid short-term contract doing front-end development work remotely that has allowed me to use new skills + my existing creative skills. I have throughly enjoyed the work so far. I'm currently connecting with new people and exploring what could be my next opportunity (which is why i'm typing a letter into a React App).</span></p><br/>\n\n\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n\n                    <Container className=\"centered\">\n\n                    <Link\n                        href=\"\"\n                        to=\"tldr\"\n                        spy={true}\n                        smooth={true}\n                        offset={-70}\n                        duration={800}\n                    >\n\n                        <br/>\n                        <br/> \n                        <span className=\"tasty fa wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__slower\"><a><i className=\"fa fa-long-arrow-alt-down fa-4x wow animate__animated animate__bounce animate__delay-1s responsiveArrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\" /></a></span>\n                    </Link>\n\n                    </Container>\n\n                    <br/> \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n\n\n\n                    <h1 id=\"tldr\" className=\"montserratTLDR centered wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown animate_slower\"><span className=\"montserratTLDR  wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate__slower tasty\">TL;DR</span></h1><br/>\n\n\n                    <br/>\n                    <span className=\"lead centered response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><hr className=\"hrTLDR wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\" style={{maxWidth: \"330px\" }}></hr></span>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n\n\n                    <p className=\"lead centered response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower tasty spacedOut\">[PROBLEMS]</span></p>\n                    <p className=\"lead centered response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">\n                        EXCESSIVE JOB COMFORT<br/>\n                        <span className=\"tasty\">&#43;</span><br/>\n                        CAREER STAGNATION<br/>\n                        <span className=\"tasty\">&#43;</span><br/>\n                        GLOBAL PANDEMIC<br/>\n                        <span className=\"tasty\">&#43;</span><br/>\n                        LOCKDOWN<br/>\n                        <span className=\"tasty\">&#43;</span><br/>\n                        FURLOUGH<br/>\n                        <span className=\"tasty\">&#43;</span><br/>\n                        LOST JOB</span></p><br/>\n\n\n\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    \n\n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower tasty spacedOut\">[SOLUTION]</span></p>\n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">I converted a series of extremely stressful problems in my life into pursuing something I had always had interest in. It was the best decision I believe I have made in my adult life and have since committed to never allowing myself to become too comfortable or stagnant in my daily work again. My creative well-being depends on it. I can't say for sure if the problems i've mentioned above were absolutely the most difficult ones that i've ever overcome in my entire life. But given how the world felt at the time, there were moments where it certainly seemed that way. <span className=\"tasty\">Thanks for reading.<br/></span></span></p><br/>\n\n                    <br/>\n\n                    <p className=\"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower\"><span className=\"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower\">- <a href=\"https://jonathanschimpf.dev\" target=\"_blank\"  className=\"signature\">Jonathan Schimpf</a></span></p>\n\n\n                    \n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n                    <br/>\n\n\n                    <Container className=\"centered\">\n\n                    <Link\n                        href=\"\"\n                        to=\"top\"\n                        spy={true}\n                        smooth={true}\n                        offset={-70}\n                        duration={800}\n                    >\n\n                        <br/>\n                        <br/>\n                        <br/>\n\n                        <span className=\"tasty fa wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate__slower\"><a><i className=\"fa fa-long-arrow-alt-up fa-4x wow animate__animated animate__bounce animate__delay-1s responsiveArrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\" /></a></span>\n                    </Link>\n\n                    </Container>\n                    \n                    \n\n                </Container>\n            </Jumbotron>\n                \n            \n        </>\n\n\n    );\n}\n\nexport default TastyResponseComp;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport TastyResponseComp from \"./components/TastyResponse/TastyResponse\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  \n  return (\n\n    <>\n\n    <TastyResponseComp />\n\n    </>\n\n\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n// import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  \n    <App />,\n \n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n\nreportWebVitals();\n"],"sourceRoot":""}

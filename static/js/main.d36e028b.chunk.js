This affected the studio group that i had been with for many years and a job that i had admittedly grown very comfortable with. We operate on location and most of the work i was doing was all but impossible to do remotely. Everyone assumed this was a temporary precaution but as the lockdown weeks went on, and one sensationalized newscast after another started placing bets on the length of this order; it was clear this could go on for some time. And as you know, it did. Many businesses all around the globe had begun to incur supply chain issues and the clients we worked for were no different.

I would create small sites to host artwork on or sites where i could write humorous local scene report style blogs. I\u2019ve worked in an agency setting contributing image content to client website builds and loved watching them go from wireframe to final product. I truly wished my contribution could be larger. It was always one of those things that i told myself i should dive deeper into but constantly referenced my lack of \u201ctime\u201d as the reason why i hadn\u2019t.

The usual freeCodeCamp projects, Udemy courses, YouTube, Stack Oveflow, tutorial hell, picking my developer friends brains, and so on. It slowly became all I did, I needed to be dragged away from my workspace to catch a day at the beach or a walk in the Wissahickon. It was hard, but I really liked it. I had already known some of the fairly basic concepts, but as i went on i realized very quickly that i knew nothing. And i could probably count on that for some time. Long story short, after months of furlough and self exploration writing code, I got let go from a job i was comfortable with and thought was secure. There just wasn\u2019t enough work coming in and our staff was fairly large. At the time it felt terrible, but i decided to view it as a blessing in disguise. It was a decent gig and everyone was very nice, but the position didn't have much room for growth. I wasn\u2019t happy, but i wouldn\u2019t force myself to leave either. I kept myself stuck. That was a problem. Now, the growth i wanted all along had been dropped directly on my head. And instead of treating it like a negative issue, i turned it into a positive one. I had more time to pursue learning and to build projects. Specifically given the lack of places to go that were open and a job i was committed to 9-5. Throughout my lockdown learning i did eventually look into a few photo industry job opportunities and even went and toured a studio that had an open position. All of them felt very similar to my previous situation and i knew that i wanted more. I wanted to be challenged. I wanted some kind of immersive learning structure to actually build useful projects that had deadlines and would force me to progress my knowledge."})}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("br",{}),Object(c.jsx)("p",{className:"lead response wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp animate_slower",children:Object(c.jsx)("span",{className:"wow animate__animated animate__fadeIn animate_slower",children:"I explored a variety of options and eventually took a full stack bootcamp through UPENN.

As soon as i would get comfortable with one concept, the next one would crush me and it continued on that way for awhile. This learning process was both fun and enjoyable but also mentally draining and left me feeling frequently defeated. But i persisted on. This educational style was good for me because i learned how to properly research and find solutions to issues quickly out of necessity. It also taught me that nobody ever has the answer to everything, an idea that makes me smile even as i write this. I thoroughly enjoy the state of constant discovery.
